about the project:

This project is an implementation of a weighted directed graph in python and compared to different graphs algorithms implemented in Python.
our graph is implemented by python dictionary of vertexes and every vertex has its own list of values.
the vertexes implemented by the class Node, every Node has 2 python dictionary and a position.

Directed weighted graph class methods:

  Add\remove a vertex  
  connect or remove an edge between two vertexes

Graph Algorithms methods:

  connection components - returns a list of all connection components of a graph
  connection components of a specific vertex - returns a list of the vertex connection components
  Finds the shortest path between two vertices by using Dijkstra Algorithm - returns a list of the path.
