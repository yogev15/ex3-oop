מטלה רביעית ואחרונה בקורס תכנות מונחה עצמים - סמסטר א' תשפ"א דצמבר 2020

about the project:

This project is an implementation of a weighted directed graph in python and compared to different graphs algorithms implemented in Python.
our graph is implemented by python dictionary of vertexes and every vertex has its own list of values.
the vertexes implemented by the class Node, every Node has 2 python dictionary and a position.

Directed weighted graph class methods:

  Add\remove a vertex  
  connect or remove an edge between two vertexes

Graph Algorithms methods:

        connection components - returns a list of all connection components of a grap
        connection component - returns a list of the vertex connection components
        shortest_path - returns a list of the shortest path between two vertexes path
